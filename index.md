# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about myself and what I am doing at the moment.

I am a student, currently taking a bachelors degree in Business Information System.

I am a career pivoter, minimalist and zero-waste aspirant, a philomath, and a girl who wants to start her career in tech.
